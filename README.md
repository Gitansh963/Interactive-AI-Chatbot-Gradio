##OpenAI GPT Chatbot with Gradio Interface
This project demonstrates an interactive chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT model. The chatbot engages in conversations with users, generating responses based on the provided prompts. The user interface is created using Gradio, making it easy to interact with the chatbot.

#Getting Started
Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. If you haven't already, sign up for an OpenAI API key and replace "Copy-your-api-key-here" in the code with your actual key.

#Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenAI API key
##Installation
#Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gitansh963/Interactive-AI-Chatbot-Gradio.git
cd your-repo-name
```
#Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install openai gradio
```
#Set up your OpenAI API key:
Replace "Copy-your-api-key-here" in the code with your actual OpenAI API key.

##Usage
Run the script to start the Gradio interface and interact with the chatbot.

```bash
python Gpt_clone.py
```
The interface allows users to input text, simulating a conversation with the AI chatbot. The chat history is maintained, providing a more context-aware conversation.

#Customization
